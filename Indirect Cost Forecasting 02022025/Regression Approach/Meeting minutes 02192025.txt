- Federal vs State: 
- Regression approach: Create the data... Quarterly or Yearly [Expenditure impacting indirect cost, Grant type, Funding ]
- Research, Manufacturing, Instruction (Educational grants)
- Research (Federal higher indirect cost)
- So, see the lag effect of research funding or expenditure on indirect cost is the goal. By that way we could predict the indirect cost also.

Data columns could be following:

Year
Research type (Instruction or Educational grants, Service, Research - Federal)
Grant amount or Funding Amount
Expenditure 
Indirect cost rate

Indirect cost (Next year)
